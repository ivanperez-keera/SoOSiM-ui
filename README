This is the UI for the SoOSiM simulator.

There are two ways of installing this package. In both cases, you need
to have your cabal bin directory in your path. In *nix OSs, this usually
means adding $HOME/.cabal/bin to your PATH.

1) Download all the dependencies, unpack each one of them and install.
You will need:
 * keera-hails:     https://github.com/ivanperez-keera/keera-hails
 * keera-callbacks: https://github.com/ivanperez-keera/keera-callbacks
 * gloss-gtk:       https://github.com/ivanperez-keera/gloss-gtk
 * SoOSiM:          https://github.com/ivanperez-keera/SoOSiM
 * SoOSiM-ui:       https://github.com/ivanperez-keera/SoOSiM-ui

For each one of those, unpack, go into the generated dir, and
run cabal install (or 'cabal install --reinstall' if you installed
them before).

2) Use my hackage repo to install all the dependencies.

Add the following line to your .cabal/config file, right below remote-repo:
hackage.haskell.org [...]

remote-repo: ivanperez-keera:http://ivanperez-keera.github.com/packages/archive

Then run cabal update && cabal install SoOSiM-ui

In any case, you need to have a few dependencies, among them:
 - gtk:      for which you need to install the gtk development libraries
 - gtkglext: for which you need to install the gtkgl development libraries

This program has been reported working on Linux and MacOSX.
It remains untested under windows.

====

Once installed, the program opens the default example in the user interface.
With the current configuration, that cannot be changed (the reason is not as
dumb as it may seem: examples are actual haskell code, not just some file
that's opened and interpreted).

The colours used to paint the diagrams are specified in a config file.
In *nix OSs, this should be located in ~/.cabal/share/SoOSiM-ui-0.1/data/config.
This will change in the future (it's the wrong location, as changes are
lost once the version number is increased).
